Issues:

[x] Page isn't loading assets in gh-pages
[ ] Go to about. Reload page. Get 404. ?!?
[ ] Update the script to build and add the /dist to commit
[ ] Find a vue3 tutorial to learn how it all works


Cheat sheet:

npm run build
-> updates the dist folder

- add the changes to /dist as part of commit

./deploy-gh-pages.sh
-> updates the gh-pages branch
